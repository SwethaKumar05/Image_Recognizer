# Image_Recognizer
In this project, I developed an image recognition model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The model was built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), leveraging the power of deep learning for image classification tasks.

I implemented a sequential model, incorporating multiple layers including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, to capture the intricate features of the images. After flattening the images to a suitable size, the model was trained using various hyperparameters such as epochs and batch size to optimize its performance. This approach allowed the model to learn and accurately recognize the images of dogs and cats.
